# Wireframing

## Introduction

Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual representation or blueprint of a user interface (UI). It outlines the basic structure and layout of a page or screen without focusing on design elements like colors, fonts, or images. 

Wireframes are often created during the early stages of the design process and serve as a foundation for building prototypes and final UI designs.

## Importance in the Design Process

- **Clarifies Requirements**: Helps stakeholders and team members visualize and agree on functionality before development begins.
- **Speeds Up Development**: Provides a clear layout for developers to follow, reducing guesswork and miscommunication.
- **Supports Iteration**: Encourages quick feedback and rapid revisions during early design phases.
- **Improves User Experience (UX)**: Ensures that the user flow and content hierarchy make sense before committing to high-fidelity designs.

Wireframing is a crucial first step in creating user-centered designs that are functional, efficient, and easy to use.
